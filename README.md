A simple todo api written in rust.

Things to do:

 - [ ] create seeders
 - [ ] enforce type safety in open api specification with the functions
 - [ ] write the home route to be a basic explination and links to the docs and github repo
 - [ ] write some unit tests
 - [ ] write some integration tests ??? (probably not worth it, just skip this)
